2. ✅ Updated README.md with screenshot references
3. ✅ Pushed folder structure to GitHub
4. ✅ Created helper script `add-screenshots.bat`

## 📋 What You Need to Do:

### Step 1: Save Your Screenshots

You have 2 screenshots from the chat interface. Save them with these EXACT names:

1. **First Screenshot** (Temperature Trends):
   - Query: "What are the temperature trends in the Indian Ocean over the last year?"
   - Shows: Graph with temperature analysis
   - **Save as:** `demo-temperature-trends.png`

2. **Second Screenshot** (Fishing Zones):
   - Query: "Where should I fish for pomfret today near Kerala coast?"
   - Shows: Fishing zone visualization
   - **Save as:** `demo-fishing-zones.png`

### Step 2: Where to Save

Save both files in this folder:
```
C:\Users\swapn\OneDrive\Documents\Floatchat_SIH\assets\screenshots\
```

Your folder structure should look like:
```
FloatChat/
├── assets/
│   └── screenshots/
│       ├── demo-temperature-trends.png  ← Your first screenshot
│       ├── demo-fishing-zones.png       ← Your second screenshot
│       └── README.md
